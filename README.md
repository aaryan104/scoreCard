Manual Cricket Score Tracker
This web page is designed to help users manually track cricket match scores. Instead of fetching live scores from an API, it allows users to input runs, wickets, overs, and other key events manually. The page dynamically calculates and displays the current match status, making it ideal for local tournaments, practice games, or scenarios where automated scoring isn't available.

Key Features:

Manual input of runs, wickets, overs, etc.

Real-time score calculation and updates

Clean and responsive UI for easy match tracking
